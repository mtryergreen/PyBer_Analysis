# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary dataframe of the ride sharing dataframe of the ride sharing data by city type. I'll create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas as Matplotlib. In conclusion, this report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision makers at PyBer.
